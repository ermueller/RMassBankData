  mzML format and deprofiled.} \item{list}{A CSV list with
  compound informations for the 15 narcotics, as needed by
  RMassBank.} \item{infolists}{A complete CSV list with
  annotations for the 15 standards.}
  \item{infolists_incomplete}{A partial list of
  \code{infolists}, to demonstrate the download of missing
  entries.} \item{infolists_edited}{The downloaded missing
  entries, subsequently checked and completed by hand.}
  \item{results}{The intermediate and final results of the
  \code{msms_workflow} runs. This serves to build the

  workflow during the vignette build.} }
